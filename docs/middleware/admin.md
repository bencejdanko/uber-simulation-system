**I. Route-Specific Analysis (Admin Service)**

The base path for all Admin Service endpoints is `/api/v1/admin`. All endpoints require strict Admin role authentication.

---

**1. Endpoint: `POST /drivers` (Admin)**

*   **1. API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to **Admin Service** at `/drivers`. (The Admin service might internally call the Driver Service or handle creation directly).
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user. **Crucially, verify the user token contains the 'ADMIN' role/claim.**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes. Apply rate limiting based on admin user ID or source IP to prevent accidental or malicious bulk creation, though limits might be higher than public endpoints.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal. Possibly add trusted headers like `X-Admin-User-ID` derived from the token for auditing purposes in the backend. Ensure `Content-Type: application/json` header is present.

*   **2. Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** Yes, upon successful driver creation.
        *   Topic Name(s): `driver.profile.created`
        *   Event Type/Purpose: `PROFILE_CREATED`
        *   Key Payload Fields: `driverId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phoneNumber`, `address`, `carDetails`, `timestamp`.
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No, this is a synchronous API call for creation.

*   **3. Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `201 Created` response containing the created `Driver Object`.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None expected for the *calling client* based on this specific action. Other systems consuming the `driver.profile.created` Kafka event will react asynchronously.

*   **4. Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** No (POST request).
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Unlikely for the creation itself, but the Admin service might cache driver data for subsequent reads.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

---

**2. Endpoint: `POST /customers` (Admin)**

*   **1. API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to **Admin Service** at `/customers`. (The Admin service might internally call the Customer Service or handle creation directly).
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user. **Verify the user token contains the 'ADMIN' role/claim.**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes. Similar to admin driver creation.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal. Possibly add trusted headers like `X-Admin-User-ID`. Ensure `Content-Type: application/json`.

*   **2. Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** Yes, upon successful customer creation.
        *   Topic Name(s): `customer.profile.created`
        *   Event Type/Purpose: `PROFILE_CREATED`
        *   Key Payload Fields: `customerId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phoneNumber`, `address`, `creditCardDetails` (masked/tokenized info only), `timestamp`.
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No.

*   **3. Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `201 Created` response containing the created `Customer Object` (with sensitive CC details masked).
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None expected for the calling client. Other systems consuming the `customer.profile.created` event will react asynchronously.

*   **4. Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** No (POST request).
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Unlikely for creation, potential caching for subsequent reads.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

**3. Endpoint: `GET /drivers/{driver_id}` (Admin)**

*   **1. API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to **Admin Service** at `/drivers/{driver_id}`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user. **Verify the user token contains the 'ADMIN' role/claim.** Validate `driver_id` path parameter format (`xxx-xx-xxxx`).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes. Per-admin user rate limiting.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal.

*   **2. Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No (GET request).
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No directly for serving the request. The data retrieved might have been updated based on Kafka events consumed by the Admin or underlying Driver service in the background.

*   **3. Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` response containing the `Driver Object` (potentially with extra admin-only fields).
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** No further updates expected for this specific GET request.

*   **4. Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** Yes, potentially cacheable with a short TTL (e.g., 1-5 minutes). Keyed by the full path (`/api/v1/admin/drivers/{driver_id}`). Invalidation would be needed if the Admin service can update drivers (or receives update events).
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Yes, the Admin service should cache driver details it retrieves (either fetched from Driver Service or its own read store) to improve performance.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No (due to authentication and potentially sensitive admin data).

---

**4. Endpoint: `GET /customers/{customer_id}` (Admin)**

*   **1. API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to **Admin Service** at `/customers/{customer_id}`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user. **Verify the user token contains the 'ADMIN' role/claim.** Validate `customer_id` path parameter format (`xxx-xx-xxxx`).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes. Per-admin user rate limiting.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal.

*   **2. Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No (GET request).
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No directly.

*   **3. Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` response containing the `Customer Object` (sensitive CC details masked, potentially with extra admin-only fields).
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** No further updates expected for this specific GET request.

*   **4. Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** Yes, potentially cacheable with a short TTL. Keyed by the full path.
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Yes, the Admin service should cache customer details it retrieves.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

**5. Endpoint: `GET /statistics` (Admin)**

*   **1. API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to **Admin Service** at `/statistics`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user. **Verify the user token contains the 'ADMIN' role/claim.**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes. These can be expensive queries, so rate limiting per admin user is important to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal. Maybe validate date formats in query parameters if feasible.

*   **2. Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No (GET request).
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No *directly* to serve the request. However, the Admin service's underlying data aggregation logic *relies heavily* on consuming events like `ride.completed`, `billing.paid` (or others) asynchronously to build its reporting data store.

*   **3. Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` response containing the `SystemStatistics Object`.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None. This provides a snapshot based on the query parameters. The client would need to re-query to get updated statistics.

*   **4. Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** Yes, highly recommended. Cache keyed by the full path including query parameters (e.g., `/api/v1/admin/statistics?start_date=...&end_date=...&area_type=...`). TTL depends on how frequently statistics are updated (e.g., hourly, daily).
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** **Essential.** The Admin service *must* cache the results of these potentially expensive aggregation queries (e.g., in Redis) with appropriate TTLs.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

---

**6. Endpoint: `GET /charts` (Admin)**

*   **1. API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to **Admin Service** at `/charts`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user. **Verify the user token contains the 'ADMIN' role/claim.**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes. Similar to `/statistics`, rate limit per admin user.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal. Validate required `chart_type` query parameter presence.

*   **2. Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No (GET request).
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No *directly*. Similar to `/statistics`, relies on asynchronously consumed events to build the underlying data source.

*   **3. Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` response containing the `ChartData Object`.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None. Client must re-query for updated chart data.

*   **4. Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** Yes, highly recommended. Keyed by the full path including all relevant query parameters (`chart_type`, date ranges, filters). TTL depends on data freshness requirements.
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** **Essential.** Cache formatted chart data results, keyed by query parameters.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

---

**7. Endpoint: `GET /bills` (Admin)**

*   **1. API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to **Admin Service** at `/bills`. (Admin service might proxy to Billing Service or query its own read model/cache).
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user. **Verify the user token contains the 'ADMIN' role/claim.**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes. Standard rate limiting for list endpoints.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal.

*   **2. Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No (GET request).
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No directly. The data source (Billing Service or Admin Service read model) is likely populated/updated based on events like `ride.completed` or `payment.processed`.

*   **3. Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` response containing a JSON array of `BillingInformation Object`s.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None. Client would need to re-query or implement pagination.

*   **4. Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** Possible for common queries (e.g., recent bills without filters) with a short TTL. Caching becomes less effective with many filter combinations.
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Yes, the Admin service (or the Billing Service it interacts with) should cache lists of bills, especially paginated results.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

---

**8. Endpoint: `GET /bills/{billing_id}` (Admin)**

*   **1. API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to **Admin Service** at `/bills/{billing_id}`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user. **Verify the user token contains the 'ADMIN' role/claim.** Validate `billing_id` path parameter format (`xxx-xx-xxxx`).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes. Per-admin user rate limiting.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal.

*   **2. Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No (GET request).
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No directly.

*   **3. Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` response containing the `BillingInformation Object`.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None.

*   **4. Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** Yes, potentially cacheable with a short TTL. Keyed by the full path.
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Yes, the Admin service (or underlying Billing Service) should cache individual billing records.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

**II. Service-Wide Analysis (Admin Service)**

**1. Signup Flow (Admin Service Specifics):**

The Admin Service does *not* handle public user self-registration. It provides endpoints (`POST /drivers`, `POST /customers`) for **administrators** to create new Driver or Customer profiles.

*   **Synchronous Steps:**
    1.  Admin Client sends `POST /api/v1/admin/drivers` (or `/customers`) with data and Bearer token to API Gateway.
    2.  API Gateway validates the token, checks for 'ADMIN' role, routes to Admin Service.
    3.  Admin Service receives the request.
    4.  Admin Service performs **key validations** (see below).
    5.  If valid, Admin Service persists the new entity (either directly or by calling the respective Driver/Customer service). This involves a DB write.
    6.  Admin Service triggers the publishing of a Kafka event (see Async Steps).
    7.  Admin Service sends a `201 Created` HTTP response back through the Gateway to the Admin Client, containing the newly created object.
*   **Asynchronous Steps:**
    1.  Following successful synchronous creation, the Admin Service publishes an event to Kafka.
        *   For `POST /drivers`: Topic `driver.profile.created`, Purpose: Notify system of new driver profile.
        *   For `POST /customers`: Topic `customer.profile.created`, Purpose: Notify system of new customer profile.
    2.  Other services (potentially search indexers, notification services, etc.) consume these events.
*   **Key Validations (by Admin Service):**
    *   **`driverId` / `customerId`:** Presence, uniqueness check (critical), adherence to SSN format (`xxx-xx-xxxx`).
    *   **Required Fields:** Presence check for all required fields as per `Driver Input Object` / `Customer Input Object` (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`, `address` fields, `phoneNumber`, `email`, `carDetails` for drivers).
    *   **Format Validation:** Email format, State (valid US state abbr/name), Zip Code format (`xxxxx` or `xxxxx-xxxx`), potentially phone number format.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Basic checks like `year` in `carDetails` being a reasonable integer. (Does *not* include password validation as admins likely don't set initial passwords here; that's part of Auth service registration).

**2. Authentication & Authorization Strategy (Overall):**

*   **Mechanism:** Bearer Token (JWT) required for *all* endpoints under `/api/v1/admin`.
*   **Gateway Role:**
    *   Verify the presence of the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    *   Validate the JWT `accessToken`: check signature, expiration (`exp`), issuer (`iss`).
    *   Extract claims from the token, specifically the user's roles/permissions.
    *   **Enforce Authorization:** Reject requests (`403 Forbidden` or `401 Unauthorized`) if the token does *not* contain the required 'ADMIN' role/claim.
    *   Pass verified user identity (`userId`, roles) to the Admin Service via trusted headers (e.g., `X-User-ID`, `X-User-Roles`) or expect the service to re-parse the token if needed (less common).
*   **Service Role:**
    *   **Trust** the Gateway's token validation and role check.
    *   Perform **fine-grained authorization** if necessary (though for admin, access is usually broad).
    *   Use the admin's identity (`X-Admin-User-ID`) for logging and auditing purposes.

**3. Validation Strategy (Overall):**

*   **Gateway Validation:**
    *   Perform minimal, foundational validation.
    *   Check path parameter formats where simple patterns exist (e.g., ensuring `{driver_id}` matches `xxx-xx-xxxx` regex).
    *   Ensure `Content-Type: application/json` header is present and correct for `POST`/`PATCH` requests.
    *   Potentially enforce basic request size limits.
*   **Service Validation:**
    *   The **Admin Service** is responsible for **all primary business logic validation**.
    *   **Format Adherence:** SSN format for IDs, email format, State (valid US), Zip Code format.
    *   **Required Field Presence:** As defined in the request objects (`Driver Input Object`, `Customer Input Object`).
    *   **Data Range/Value Checks:** Ensure numeric values are within expected ranges (e.g., latitude/longitude if applicable, though less common for admin creation). Validate enum values in query parameters (e.g., `area_type`, `chart_type`).
    *   **Existence Checks:** Before attempting updates/deletes (implicitly handled by 404 responses). For creation, check for **duplicate** `driverId`/`customerId`.
    *   **Cross-Field Consistency:** Minimal expected in admin creation, but could apply (e.g., ensuring `start_date` is before `end_date` in query parameters).
    *   Reference the "Validation Notes" sections within the API docs for
