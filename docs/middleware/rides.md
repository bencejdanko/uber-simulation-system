**I. Route-Specific Analysis (Rides Service)**

---

**1. Endpoint: `POST /rides` (Request Ride)**

*   **API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to Rides Service at `/rides`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Verify token belongs to an authenticated user (likely Customer role).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes, High Priority. Limit per authenticated customer to prevent spamming ride requests. Consider IP-based limiting for unauthenticated requests (though this endpoint requires auth).
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal. Could add `X-User-ID` header extracted from the token for downstream service use. Could potentially strip sensitive info from the response if needed, though the `202 Accepted` response seems safe.
*   **Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** Yes, upon successful initial acceptance and creation of the ride record.
        *   Topic Name(s): `ride.requested`
        *   Event Type/Purpose: `RIDE_REQUESTED` (To initiate the asynchronous driver matching process).
        *   Key Payload Fields: `rideId` (newly generated), `customerId` (from token), `pickupLocation`, `dropoffLocation`, `requestTimestamp`, `predictedFare`.
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No, this endpoint initiates the process.
*   **Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `202 Accepted` containing the initial `Ride Object` (status `REQUESTED`).
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** Essential. The client needs updates on matching status (`NO_DRIVERS_AVAILABLE`, `ACCEPTED`), driver details upon acceptance, driver location (`DRIVER_ARRIVED`), ride progress (`IN_PROGRESS`), and final state (`COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`). This strongly necessitates a **WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE)** connection where the client subscribes to events scoped to their specific `rideId`. Polling `GET /rides/{ride_id}` is a less efficient alternative.
*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** No. POST requests are not cacheable.
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** No, this creates a new resource.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

**2. Endpoint: `GET /rides/{ride_id}` (Get Ride Details)**

*   **API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to Rides Service at `/rides/{ride_id}`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. The *service* must perform authorization: verify the authenticated user (`customerId` or `driverId` from token) is associated with this `ride_id`, or the user has an Admin role.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes, Moderate Priority. Limit per user/ride_id to prevent excessive polling if used as an update mechanism.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal. Could add `X-User-ID` header.
*   **Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No. This is a read operation.
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No. Reads the current state from the Rides Service database/cache.
*   **Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` containing the current `Ride Object`.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None expected *from this specific call*. Updates should be pushed via WebSocket/SSE.
*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** Potentially, with a **very short TTL (e.g., 1-5 seconds)**. Key must include `ride_id` AND the `Authorization` header (or derived `userId`). High invalidation rate due to frequent status changes makes this challenging and potentially low value.
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Yes. The Rides Service should cache ride states (especially active ones) in memory or Redis for fast retrieval, invalidated by internal state change events (often driven by Kafka).
    *   **CDN Caching:** No (due to Authentication).

---

**3. Endpoint: `GET /rides` (List Rides)**

*   **API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to Rides Service at `/rides`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. Service filters results based on the authenticated user (`customerId` or `driverId`). Gateway *must* verify Admin role in token if `for_customer_id` or `for_driver_id` query parameters are present, potentially rejecting early (`403 Forbidden`) if non-admin attempts to use them.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes, Moderate Priority. Limit per user to prevent fetching large histories frequently.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal.
*   **Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No. Read operation.
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No. Reads historical/current data.
*   **Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` containing a JSON array of `Ride Object`s.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None expected from this call.
*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** Potentially, with a moderate TTL (e.g., 30-60 seconds). Key must include query parameters AND `Authorization` header. Cache should ideally be invalidated when a ride associated with the user changes to a terminal state (COMPLETED, CANCELLED). Complexity might outweigh benefits.
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Yes. The service might cache lists of ride IDs per user or use efficient database indexing.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

---

**4. Endpoint: `DELETE /rides/{ride_id}` (Cancel Ride)**

*   **API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to Rides Service at `/rides/{ride_id}`.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token. The *service* must perform authorization: verify the authenticated user is allowed to cancel this ride (e.g., is the customer or assigned driver, and the ride is in a cancellable state like `REQUESTED` or `ACCEPTED`).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes, Moderate Priority. Limit per user/ride_id.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal.
*   **Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** Yes, upon successful cancellation.
        *   Topic Name(s): `ride.cancelled`
        *   Event Type/Purpose: `RIDE_CANCELLED` (To notify other systems/parties and potentially trigger re-matching if cancelled by driver).
        *   Key Payload Fields: `rideId`, `customerId`, `driverId` (if assigned), `cancelledBy` ("CUSTOMER" or "DRIVER" based on who initiated), `timestamp`, `previousStatus`.
    *   **Topics Consumed:** No.
*   **Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `204 No Content`.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** The *other* party involved (e.g., driver if customer cancels, customer if driver cancels) needs notification, likely via WebSocket/SSE driven by the `ride.cancelled` Kafka event.
*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** No. DELETE methods are not cacheable. Must invalidate any cached `GET /rides/{ride_id}` entry.
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** Yes. Invalidate any cached state for this `rideId`.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

---

**5. Endpoint: `GET /drivers/nearby` (Find Nearby Drivers)**

*   **API Gateway Responsibilities:**
    *   **Routing Target:** Routes to Rides Service at `/drivers/nearby`. (Note: Path suggests drivers, but functionality placed under Rides Service implies it orchestrates this, likely querying location data sourced from Driver Service).
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Verify valid Bearer Token (likely Customer role). Prevent unauthenticated scraping.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Yes, **Very High Priority**. This endpoint involves a potentially expensive geo-spatial query and exposes near real-time driver locations. Implement strict limits per user and potentially globally.
    *   **Request/Response Transformation:** Minimal.
*   **Kafka Topic Interaction:**
    *   **Topics Produced:** No. Read operation.
    *   **Topics Consumed:** Indirectly. The endpoint relies on up-to-date driver location data. This data is likely maintained in a specialized cache (e.g., Redis Geo) within or accessible by the Rides/Driver service, which *consumes* `driver.location.updated` events from Kafka in the background to keep the cache current. The API call itself doesn't consume events.
*   **Client Update Mechanism:**
    *   **Primary Response:** Synchronous HTTP `200 OK` with a JSON array of `Nearby Driver Object`s.
    *   **Subsequent/Asynchronous Updates:** None from this specific call. A UI showing live driver locations would either poll this endpoint frequently (inefficient) or ideally receive location updates via **WebSocket/SSE** for drivers within a certain bounding box around the user.
*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Gateway Caching:** No. Data is extremely volatile (real-time locations).
    *   **Service-Level Caching:** **Essential**. The backend *must* use a highly optimized cache (like Redis with Geo commands, or a dedicated spatial index) for driver locations, updated asynchronously by location events. This endpoint queries the cache, not the primary driver database.
    *   **CDN Caching:** No.

**II. Service-Wide Analysis (Rides Service)**

**1. Signup Flow (Rides Service Specifics):**

*   The **Rides Service** does *not* directly handle user signup (Driver or Customer).
*   **Signup Trigger:** Signup is initiated via the **Auth Service** (`POST /auth/register/customer` or `POST /auth/register/driver`).
*   **Auth Service Synchronous Steps:** Validates input, creates user credentials (hashed password) in its DB, generates JWTs, returns tokens to the client.
*   **Auth Service Asynchronous Steps:** Publishes a `user.registered` event to Kafka containing `userId`, `userType`, email, name, phone, and potentially other initial details.
*   **Profile Creation:** The **Customer Service** or **Driver Service** consumes the `user.registered` event and creates the corresponding profile in *its* database.
*   **Rides Service Role:** The Rides Service *uses* these pre-existing Customer and Driver profiles (identified by `customerId` and `driverId`, often derived from the Bearer Token) when processing ride requests (`POST /rides`), assigning drivers, and retrieving ride details (`GET /rides/{id}`). It relies on the Customer/Driver services for profile data validity.
*   **Key Validations (Handled by Auth/Customer/Driver Services):** SSN Format for IDs, email format, password complexity, required fields for profile creation (name, phone, potentially address/car details for drivers). Duplicate `userId` / `email` checks are handled by the Auth service.

**2. Authentication & Authorization Strategy (Overall):**

*   **Mechanism:** All Rides Service endpoints require a `Bearer Token` (JWT) obtained from the Auth Service via login or registration.
*   **Gateway Role:**
    *   Verify the presence, format (`Bearer <token>`), signature, and expiration of the JWT `accessToken` on every request to the Rides Service.
    *   Reject requests with invalid/expired tokens immediately (`401 Unauthorized`).
    *   Extract `userId` and potentially `roles` (e.g., `CUSTOMER`, `DRIVER`, `ADMIN`) from the token claims.
    *   Optionally, pass `userId` and `roles` to the Rides Service via trusted headers (e.g., `X-User-ID`, `X-User-Roles`).
    *   Perform basic role checks for admin-only query parameters (`GET /rides`).
*   **Service Role (Rides Service):**
    *   Trust that the token itself has been validated by the Gateway.
    *   Perform *resource-specific authorization* using the `userId` and `roles` provided:
        *   `POST /rides`: Verify the user role is `CUSTOMER`. Use `userId` as `customerId`.
        *   `GET /rides/{ride_id}`, `DELETE /rides/{ride_id}`: Verify the `userId` matches the `customerId` or the (assigned) `driverId` of the specified `rideId`, OR that the user has an `ADMIN` role. Return `403 Forbidden` if access is denied.
        *   `GET /rides`: Filter results based on the `userId` (matching `customerId` or `driverId`). Check for `ADMIN` role if `for_customer_id` or `for_driver_id` parameters are used.
        *   `GET /drivers/nearby`: Verify the user role is `CUSTOMER` (or potentially `ADMIN`).

**3. Validation Strategy (Overall):**

*   **Gateway Validation:** Minimal, focusing on request structure and basic formats:
    *   Path parameter format (check if `ride_id` matches the expected SSN format `xxx-xx-xxxx`).
    *   Query parameter types (e.g., `limit`/`offset`/`radius_miles` are numeric).
    *   Presence of `Content-Type: application/json` for `POST /rides`.
    *   Presence and basic format of `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
*   **Service Validation (Rides Service):** Responsible for primary business logic validation:
    *   **Input Data:** Validate `pickupLocation` and `dropoffLocation` coordinates (valid latitude/longitude ranges) in `POST /rides`.
    *   **ID Existence/Format:** Ensure provided IDs (like `ride_id` in path) are valid format and exist. Use `customerId` from validated token.
    *   **State Logic:** Enforce state transition rules (e.g., cannot cancel a `COMPLETED` ride via `DELETE /rides/{ride_id}`). Check ride status for applicable actions.
    *   **Resource Ownership:** Implicitly validated during authorization checks (e.g., ensuring customer requesting details owns the ride).
    *   **Dependencies:** Handle potential errors from interactions with other services (e.g., Pricing service failure during `POST /rides`, inability to fetch driver locations for `GET /drivers/nearby`).
