**Subject: URGENT CATCH-UP: Your Goals & Duties for April 16th - 17th**

Hi Anne,

We need to urgently catch up on the client setup and UI shells from Mon/Tue and prepare for integration.

**Accumulated & New Responsibilities for Wed, Apr 16th & Thurs, Apr 17th:**

1.  **Support Client Project Setup (CL-1) (Wed Morning):** Actively support David to ensure the client project setup is completed, runnable, and documented **by mid-day Wed, Apr 16th.**
2.  **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (CL-2): Complete Basic UI Layouts (Target: EOD Wed, Apr 16th):**
    *   **Action:** Complete the implementation of the basic UI shells/pages for **Customer, Rides, and Billing** modules. Focus on structure and navigation. They should render without errors.
    *   **Deliverable:** Committed UI components for basic Customer/Rides/Billing views.
3.  **LEAD API Client / Service Call Functions (Stubs) (CL-3) (Target: EOD Wed, Apr 16th):**
    *   **Action:** Lead the implementation of the API client module. Define a consistent structure (e.g., handling base URLs, auth headers). Implement stub functions specifically for **Customer, Rides, and Billing** endpoints needed soon (POST /customers, GET /customers/{id}, GET /customers, POST /rides, GET /rides/{id}, GET /bills). Coordinate with David.
    *   **Deliverable:** Committed API client module/functions ready for integration.
4.  **Begin Core Create/View Integration (Customer) (CL-4) (Thurs, Apr 17th):**
    *   **Action:** As *soon* as Cyril notifies that `POST /customers` and `GET /customers/{id}` are available (even basic versions), **start integrating** these calls into your Customer UI shells (create form, profile view). Implement basic loading/error handling.
    *   **Deliverable:** Progress on integrating Customer Create/View functionality with live (basic) APIs.

**By End of Day Wednesday, April 16th, you MUST have:**
*   Ensured client setup is complete (CL-1).
*   Completed the basic UI shells for Customer/Rides/Billing (CL-2).
*   Led implementation of API client stubs for Customer/Rides/Billing (CL-3).

**By End of Day Thursday, April 17th, you MUST have:**
*   Made demonstrable progress integrating the Customer Create form and View profile with the actual backend APIs (CL-4).

Catching up on the client foundations is critical. Your lead on the API client structure is important for consistency. Communicate progress and blockers.
