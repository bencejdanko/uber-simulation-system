**Subject: URGENT CATCH-UP: Your Goals & Duties for April 16th - 17th**

Hi David,

We need to urgently catch up on the client setup and UI shells from Mon/Tue. The detailed plan is good, but we need functional code committed.

**Accumulated & New Responsibilities for Wed, Apr 16th & Thurs, Apr 17th:**

1.  **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (CL-1): Complete Client Project Setup (Target: Morning Wed, Apr 16th):**
    *   **Action:** You *must* complete the setup of the client-side application project based on your plan. Ensure it's runnable, includes basic structure/modules, and routing stubs work.
    *   **Deliverable:** Runnable client project committed. `/docs/development_setup.md` updated with clear setup instructions.
2.  **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (CL-2): Complete Basic UI Layouts (Target: EOD Wed, Apr 16th):**
    *   **Action:** Complete the implementation of the basic UI shells/pages for **Driver and Admin** modules. Focus on structure and navigation. They should render without errors.
    *   **Deliverable:** Committed UI components for basic Driver/Admin views.
3.  **Implement API Client / Service Call Functions (Stubs) (CL-3) (Target: EOD Wed, Apr 16th):**
    *   **Action:** Start implementing the functions/services within the client to make API calls. Focus first on stubs for **Driver** and **Admin** endpoints you'll need soon (POST /drivers, GET /drivers/{id}, GET /drivers, POST /admin/drivers, GET /admin/drivers/{id}). Collaborate with Anne on a consistent structure.
    *   **Deliverable:** Committed API client code with stub functions for Driver/Admin.
4.  **Begin Core Create/View Integration (Driver) (CL-4) (Thurs, Apr 17th):**
    *   **Action:** As *soon* as Bence notifies that `POST /drivers` and `GET /drivers/{id}` are available (even basic versions), **start integrating** these calls into your Driver UI shells (create form, profile view). Implement basic loading/error handling.
    *   **Deliverable:** Progress on integrating Driver Create/View functionality with live (basic) APIs.

**By End of Day Wednesday, April 16th, you MUST have:**
*   Completed the runnable client setup (CL-1).
*   Completed the basic UI shells for Driver/Admin (CL-2).
*   Implemented API client stubs for Driver/Admin (CL-3).

**By End of Day Thursday, April 17th, you MUST have:**
*   Made demonstrable progress integrating the Driver Create form and View profile with the actual backend APIs (CL-4).

We are significantly behind on the client side. Completing the setup and basic shells is critical for integration starting Thursday. Communicate progress and blockers.
