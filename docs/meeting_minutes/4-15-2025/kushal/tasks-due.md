**Subject: URGENT: Your Goals & Duties for April 16th - 17th**

Hi Kushal,

We are currently blocked waiting for the database schema and setup. Your tasks from Mon/Tue are now critical priorities for Wednesday.

**Accumulated & New Responsibilities for Wed, Apr 16th & Thurs, Apr 17th:**

1.  **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (DB-1): Finalize & Document Schema (Target: Mid-day Wed, Apr 16th):**
    *   **Action:** You *must* finalize the precise database schema definitions based on API docs and any input received from Middleware (or make best-guess assumptions if input is still missing and document them). Resolve ambiguities (CC/SSN etc.).
    *   **Deliverable:** Update `/docs/database/schema.md` with the **complete and final** schema. **Notify the team channel the moment this is done.**
2.  **URGENT (DB-3): Implement DB Creation Scripts (Target: EOD Wed, Apr 16th):**
    *   **Action:** Based *immediately* on the finalized schema, write and test the SQL/NoSQL scripts to create all tables/collections. Include basic ID indexing.
    *   **Deliverable:** Functional scripts committed to `/database/creation_scripts.md` or `/database/`. Scripts *must* run successfully on the dev DB instance (coordinate testing with Nairui). **Notify the team channel when scripts are ready for Middleware.**
3.  **Support DB Setup (DB-2) (Ongoing Wed):** Continue assisting Nairui as needed to ensure the DB instance is stable and accessible.
4.  **Implement Initial Data Loading Script (DB-4) (Thurs, Apr 17th):**
    *   **Action:** Create the script to populate basic sample data (1-2 drivers/customers minimum) to help with basic testing.
    *   **Deliverable:** Script committed to `/database/`.

**By End of Day Wednesday, April 16th, you MUST have:**
*   Finalized and documented the database schema (`schema.md` updated).
*   Completed and tested the database creation scripts.

**By End of Day Thursday, April 17th, you MUST have:**
*   Completed the initial data loading script.
*   Ensured the database is fully ready for Middleware development.

Failure to complete the schema and creation scripts on Wednesday will make the Friday milestone impossible. Communicate progress and any blockers IMMEDIATELY.
