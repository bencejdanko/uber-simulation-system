We need to shift towards an **event-driven, Kafka-centric architecture** where Mongoose is used for persistence *after* critical path operations are handled asynchronously. Kafka will act as the central nervous system, decoupling services and buffering high request volumes.

**Critique of Previous Approach under High Load:**

*   **Synchronous Bottlenecks:** `POST /rides` involving validation, price prediction, DB write, and *initiating* matching synchronously would crumble under 1000 req/sec. Similarly, `POST /users` hitting the DB 100 times/sec synchronously is risky.
*   **Tight Coupling:** Direct REST calls between services (e.g., Rides needing instant Driver locations) create dependencies that fail under load.
*   **Scalability Issues:** Scaling traditional REST services often involves simply adding more instances, but if the underlying database or synchronous workflows are the bottleneck, this yields diminishing returns.

**New Approach: Kafka-Centric Event-Driven Architecture**

The core idea is to make the initial request handling extremely fast and lightweight. The API Gateway validates minimally, accepts the request, publishes an event to Kafka, and immediately returns `202 Accepted`. Dedicated consumer services pick up these events from Kafka topics and perform the actual work asynchronously.

**Revised Technology Stack:**

*   **Core Language/Runtime:** Node.js with TypeScript (Still suitable).
*   **Messaging Backbone:** **Apache Kafka** (Essential for decoupling, buffering, and asynchronous processing).
*   **Web Framework (API Gateway / Read APIs):** Express.js (Lightweight and familiar).
*   **Database ODM:** **Mongoose** (For interacting with MongoDB where state needs to be persisted).
*   **Database (Persistence):** **MongoDB** (Stores the canonical state of users, rides, bills, etc.).
*   **Caching/Fast Lookups:** **Redis** (Crucial for driver locations, session data, potentially caching frequently read data. Redis Stack offers JSON and Geo-spatial capabilities).
*   **Kafka Client Library (Node.js):** **kafkajs** (Modern, promise-based Kafka client).
*   **Containerization:** **Docker & Docker Compose** (For local dev), **Kubernetes** (Recommended for production deployment and scaling Kafka/consumers).
*   **Logging:** Pino (Structured logging is even more critical in distributed systems).
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana (Essential for observing Kafka, consumers, and overall system health).
*   **API Gateway (Optional but Recommended):** A dedicated gateway (like Kong, Tyk, or even a specialized Node.js/Express app) can handle routing, auth, rate limiting, and Kafka production centrally.

**Key Kafka Topics (Examples):**

*   `signup_requests` (Contains raw signup data for drivers/customers)
*   `ride_requests` (Contains pickup/dropoff locations from customer requests)
*   `driver_location_updates` (Continuous stream of driver locations)
*   `driver_actions` (e.g., `accept_ride`, `mark_arrived`, `start_trip`, `end_trip`)
*   `ride_events` (Internal state changes: `ride_matched`, `ride_started`, `ride_completed`, `ride_cancelled`, `matching_failed`)
*   `billing_tasks` (Triggered by `ride_completed`, contains data needed to create a bill)
*   `notification_tasks` (Events triggering push notifications/SMS)

**Conceptual Service Interaction Flow (Ride Request Example):**

1.  **Customer App** -> `POST /rides` to **API Gateway**.
2.  **API Gateway:** Authenticates user, validates basic input (lat/lon format), produces message to `ride_requests` topic in Kafka, returns `202 Accepted` immediately.
3.  **Ride Request Consumer Service:** Consumes from `ride_requests`.
    *   Calls Pricing Logic (could be internal or another service/consumer listening to `ride_requests`).
    *   Queries **Driver Location Service/Cache (Redis)** for nearby drivers.
    *   Performs matching logic.
    *   If matched: Produces `ride_matched` event to `ride_events` topic (includes driverId, customerId, predicted fare). Persists initial Ride object (Mongoose) with `PENDING_ACCEPTANCE` status. Notifies Driver via `notification_tasks`.
    *   If no match: Produces `matching_failed` event to `ride_events`. Updates Ride object (Mongoose) status. Notifies Customer via `notification_tasks`.
4.  **Driver App** -> Accepts Ride -> `POST /driver_actions/accept` to **API Gateway**.
5.  **API Gateway:** Authenticates driver, validates, produces message to `driver_actions` topic.
6.  **Ride Status Consumer Service:** Consumes `driver_actions` (`accept_ride`). Updates Ride object status (Mongoose) to `ACCEPTED`. Produces `ride_accepted` to `ride_events`. Notifies Customer via `notification_tasks`.
7.  (... Ride progresses similarly via driver actions and Ride Status Consumer updates ...)
8.  Driver ends trip -> produces `end_trip` action to `driver_actions`.
9.  **Ride Status Consumer Service:** Consumes `end_trip`. Calculates final fare/distance. Updates Ride object status (Mongoose) to `COMPLETED`. Produces `ride_completed` event to `ride_events` (includes all final details).
10. **Billing Consumer Service:** Consumes `ride_completed`. Creates Billing record (Mongoose).
11. **Notification Consumer Service:** Consumes relevant events (`ride_matched`, `matching_failed`, `ride_accepted`, etc.) and sends notifications.

3.  **Define Kafka Topics:** Agree on and document the initial set of Kafka topics and their expected message schemas (use Avro or JSON schema potentially later, start with documented TS interfaces).

**Phase 1: API Gateway & Core Producers (Approx. 3-5 hours)**

4.  **Setup API Gateway Service:**
    *   Action: Create a new Node.js/Express service (`api-gateway`). Use the shared base project if created.

    *   Action: Configure basic Express app (`app.ts`), server (`server.ts`), logging, config.
    *   Action: Implement Kafka producer setup using `kafkajs` (ensure graceful shutdown).
5.  **Implement High-Volume Endpoints (Producer Only):**
    *   Action: Implement `POST /api/v1/rides`:
        *   Perform minimal validation (auth token presence, basic lat/lon format).
        *   Construct the `ride_requests` message payload.
        *   Use the Kafka producer to send the message to the `ride_requests` topic.
        *   Return `202 Accepted` immediately upon successful production (or handle producer errors).

        *   Construct the `signup_requests` message payload.
        *   Produce to `signup_requests` topic.
        *   Return `202 Accepted`.
    *   Action: Implement `POST /api/v1/drivers/:driver_id/location`:
        *   Minimal validation.
        *   Produce location update message to `driver_location_updates` topic.
        *   Return `202 Accepted`.
    *   Action: Implement `POST /api/v1/driver_actions/*` (e.g., `/accept`, `/arrive`, `/start`, `/end`):

        *   Produce relevant action message to `driver_actions` topic.
        *   Return `202 Accepted`.

**Phase 2: Core Consumer Services & Persistence (Approx. 6-10 hours per core service)**

6.  **Setup Signup Consumer Service:**
    *   Action: Create a new Node.js service (`signup-consumer`). Use the base project.
    *   Action: Install `kafkajs`, `mongoose`, `pino`, `dotenv`.
    *   Action: Implement Mongoose connection (`db.ts`) and basic User/Driver schemas/models (`*.model.ts`).
    *   Action: Implement a Kafka consumer using `kafkajs` to subscribe to the `signup_requests` topic (use a unique `groupId`).
    *   Action: In the consumer logic (`eachMessage` handler):
        *   Parse the message.
        *   Perform **full validation** (state, zip, email, SSN format, etc. - reuse DTOs/validation logic).
        *   Use Mongoose models to create the Customer or Driver record in MongoDB. Handle potential DB errors (e.g., duplicate keys).
        *   Implement error handling (retries, dead-letter queue - DLQ - mechanism for unprocessable messages).
        *   Commit Kafka offsets only after successful processing.
7.  **Setup Driver Location Service:**
    *   Action: Create a new Node.js service (`location-consumer`).
    *   Action: Install `kafkajs`, `redis`, `pino`, `dotenv`. Mongoose might be needed if persisting location history.

    *   Action: In the consumer logic:
        *   Parse location update.
        *   Use Redis geo-spatial commands (`GEOADD`) to store/update driver location (e.g., in a sorted set `driver_locations`).
        *   Consider storing additional driver info (status, ID) in Redis Hashes for quick lookups.
        *   (Optional) Persist location history to MongoDB via Mongoose if needed.
    *   Action: Expose an internal mechanism (e.g., simple REST endpoint for service-to-service or direct Redis query logic) for other services to query nearby drivers using `GEORADIUS` or `GEOSEARCH`.
8.  **Setup Initial Ride Request Consumer Service:**
    *   Action: Create a new Node.js service (`ride-request-consumer`).
    *   Action: Install `kafkajs`, `mongoose`, `pino`, `dotenv`, `redis`.

    *   Action: In the consumer logic:
        *   Parse request.
        *   Persist initial Ride record (Mongoose) with `REQUESTED` status.
        *   Implement basic matching: Query Driver Location Service/Redis for nearby available drivers.
        *   (Placeholder) Implement simple matching (e.g., pick the closest).
        *   If matched: Update Ride record (Mongoose) with `driverId` and `PENDING_ACCEPTANCE` status. Produce `ride_matched` event (include driverId, customerId) to `ride_events` topic. Produce notification task.
        *   If no match: Update Ride record (Mongoose) status to `NO_DRIVERS_AVAILABLE`. Produce `matching_failed` event. Produce notification task.

    *   Action: Implement Mongoose connection (using Ride model).
    *   Action: Implement Kafka consumer for `driver_actions` topic.
    *   Action: In the consumer logic (handle different action types):
        *   Parse action (e.g., `accept_ride`, `end_trip`).
        *   Find the corresponding Ride record (Mongoose).
        *   Validate state transition (e.g., can only accept if `PENDING_ACCEPTANCE`).
        *   Update Ride status and timestamps in MongoDB.
        *   If `end_trip`: Calculate fare/distance (placeholder logic). Update Ride record. Produce `ride_completed` event to `ride_events` topic (with all necessary data for billing).
        *   Produce other relevant events (`ride_accepted`, `ride_started`, etc.) to `ride_events`.
        *   Handle errors, commit offsets.
10. **Setup Basic Billing Consumer Service:**
    *   Action: Create a new Node.js service (`billing-consumer`).
    *   Action: Install `kafkajs`, `mongoose`, `pino`, `dotenv`.
    *   Action: Implement Mongoose connection and BillingInformation schema/model.
    *   Action: Implement Kafka consumer for `ride_completed` events (from `ride_events` topic).
    *   Action: In the consumer logic:
        *   Parse event data.
        *   Create and save the BillingInformation record (Mongoose).
        *   Handle errors, commit offsets.

**Phase 3: Implementing Read APIs & UI Interaction (Approx. 4-8 hours per service)**

11. **Implement Read Endpoints:**
    *   Action: Create separate Read API services (e.g., `driver-read-api`, `customer-read-api`, `ride-read-api`) OR add read endpoints to existing consumer services (simpler initially, but couples concerns).
    *   Action: These services primarily handle `GET` requests from the original API documentation.
    *   Action: They connect to MongoDB (Mongoose) and query the data populated by the consumer services.
    *   Action: Implement endpoints like `GET /drivers/{id}`, `GET /customers/{id}`, `GET /rides/{id}`, `GET /rides`, `GET /bills`, `GET /bills/{id}` etc.
    *   Action: Implement necessary authentication and authorization checks.
    *   Action: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data to reduce DB load.
12. **Address Data Consistency:**
    *   Action: Acknowledge that data read via `GET` might lag slightly behind actions submitted via `POST` due to asynchronous processing.
    *   Action: Implement strategies for the UI:
        *   Optimistic UI updates (show success immediately after `202 Accepted`, update later if failure occurs).
        *   Polling `GET /rides/{id}` after requesting a ride to check status.
        *   WebSockets (Advanced): Consumers could push updates via a WebSocket service to connected clients for real-time status changes.

**Phase 4: Advanced Features, Testing & Deployment Prep (Ongoing)**

13. **Refine Matching & Pricing:** Implement more sophisticated driver matching and dynamic pricing logic within the relevant consumer services.
14. **Implement Notifications:** Create a `notification-consumer` service that listens to relevant events and integrates with push notification/SMS providers.
15. **Implement Admin Service:** The Admin service might need consumers for certain tasks, but many endpoints (`GET /statistics`, `GET /charts`) will involve complex reads/aggregations from MongoDB (potentially requiring map-reduce or aggregation framework). `POST /drivers`, `POST /customers` could potentially publish to the *same* `signup_requests` topic used by the main API Gateway.
16. **Error Handling & DLQs:** Ensure robust error handling, retry logic, and Dead Letter Queues for all consumers. Implement mechanisms to monitor and reprocess DLQ messages.
17. **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests for individual functions/modules.
    *   **Integration tests:** Crucial for testing Kafka interactions. Use embedded Kafka libraries (`node-kafka-connect-tester`, `kafka-node-test-helper`, or dedicated testing Kafka cluster) to test producer->consumer flows.
    *   **End-to-End tests:** Simulate user actions through the API Gateway and verify results by querying Read APIs or checking database state after a delay.
18. **Monitoring & Observability:** Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring Kafka (topic lag, throughput), consumer health (CPU/memory, processing rate, errors), database performance, and Redis metrics. Use correlation IDs across logs and events.
19. **Container Orchestration:** Define Kubernetes deployment manifests for scaling services independently, especially the consumers processing high-volume topics.

This Kafka-centric approach prioritizes handling high ingress rates by deferring heavy processing. Mongoose remains vital for persisting the state that results from this asynchronous processing, serving as the source of truth for read operations and state recovery. The shift requires more infrastructure setup (Kafka, Redis) and a different mindset focused on events and eventual consistency.
