2.  **Begin Basic UI Layouts (CL-2):** On Tuesday, start implementing the basic UI shells/pages for the **Customer, Rides, and Billing** modules' main views (e.g., Customer Profile shell, Request Ride Form shell, Billing List shell). Focus on structure and navigation, not final styling. Aim for visible progress by EOD Tuesday.

**By End of Day Tuesday, April 15th, you must have:**

Please coordinate closely with David on the client setup and UI structure. Communicate any blockers immediately.
