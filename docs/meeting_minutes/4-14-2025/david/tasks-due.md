**Subject: Your Goals & Duties for April 14th - 15th**

Hi David,

For Monday, April 14th and Tuesday, April 15th, your key responsibilities are:

1.  **Lead Client Project Setup (CL-1):** By EOD Tuesday, lead the setup of the client-side application project (React/Vue/Angular). This includes the basic project structure, module definitions (Driver, Customer, Billing, Admin, Rides), and setting up routing stubs.
2.  **Ensure Basic Client Runnable & Update Docs (CL-1):** Ensure the basic client project is runnable (can start and navigate basic routes) by EOD Tuesday. Update `/docs/development_setup.md` with client setup instructions.
3.  **Begin Basic UI Layouts (CL-2):** On Tuesday, start implementing the basic UI shells/pages for the **Driver and Admin** modules' main views (e.g., Driver List shell, Admin Dashboard shell). Focus on structure and navigation, not final styling. Aim for visible progress by EOD Tuesday.

**By End of Day Tuesday, April 15th, you must have:**
*   Completed the setup of a runnable, basic client application project with structure and routing stubs.
*   Updated the development setup documentation for the client.
*   Started implementing the basic UI layout shells for the Driver and Admin modules.

Please coordinate with Anne on the overall client structure and communicate any setup blockers.
