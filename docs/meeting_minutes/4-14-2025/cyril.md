**Subject: Your Goals & Duties for April 14th - 15th**

Hi Cyril,

For Monday, April 14th and Tuesday, April 15th, your key responsibilities are:

1.  **Provide DB Schema Input (Dependency for DB-1):** **Urgently by EOD Monday**, provide Kushal and Nairui with any specific field requirements or considerations from the Middleware perspective for the Customer and Rides services.
2.  **Lead Service Project Setup (MW-1):** By EOD Tuesday, lead the setup of the basic project structures/repositories for the **Customer and Rides** services. This includes setting up the REST framework, logging, basic config management, and defining the base URL structure (`/api/v1`).
3.  **Collaborate on Common Elements (MW-1):** Work closely with Bence to establish and use common framework components, libraries, or patterns across all services where appropriate.
4.  **Ensure Basic Service Runnable & Update Docs (MW-1):** Ensure the basic Customer and Rides service projects you set up are runnable (can start without errors) by EOD Tuesday. Update `/docs/development_setup.md` with setup instructions for your services.
5.  **Implement Basic Auth Hook (MW-2):** On Tuesday, implement the placeholder/basic authentication mechanism (e.g., middleware checking for a non-empty `Authorization: Bearer Token`). This should be functional by EOD Tuesday.

**By End of Day Tuesday, April 15th, you must have:**
*   Provided your input for the database schema to Tier 3.
*   Set up runnable, basic project structures for Customer and Rides services.
*   Collaborated with Bence on common framework elements.
*   Implemented the basic authentication hook placeholder.
*   Updated the development setup documentation for your services.

Please communicate any blockers immediately, especially regarding schema input or common components.
