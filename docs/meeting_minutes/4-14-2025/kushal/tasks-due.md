**Subject: Your Goals & Duties for April 14th - 15th**

Hi Kushal,

For Monday, April 14th and Tuesday, April 15th, your key responsibilities are:

1.  **Lead Schema Finalization (DB-1):** By EOD Tuesday, you must finalize the precise database schema definitions (tables, columns, types, constraints, relationships) for all services (Driver, Customer, Billing, Admin, Rides). This includes resolving ambiguities like CC/SSN handling. **Crucially, ensure you get necessary input from Bence and Cyril (Middleware) by EOD Monday.**
2.  **Complete Schema Documentation (DB-1):** Update `/docs/database/schema.md` with the finalized schema details by EOD Tuesday.
3.  **Support DB Setup (DB-2):** Assist Nairui as needed to ensure the database instance is set up, configured, and accessible by EOD Tuesday.
4.  **Begin DB Creation Scripts (DB-3):** Based on the *finalized* schema from DB-1, start writing and testing the SQL/NoSQL scripts to create all tables/collections on Tuesday. Aim to have these scripts substantially complete and functional by EOD Tuesday.

**By End of Day Tuesday, April 15th, you must have:**
*   The database schema finalized and documented in `schema.md`.
*   Provided support for the database instance setup.
*   Made significant progress (ideally completed writing and initial testing) on the database creation scripts based on the final schema.

Please communicate any blockers immediately.
